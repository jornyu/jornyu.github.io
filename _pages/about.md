Dr. Jorn (Chi Chung) Yu is a Professor of Forensic Science at Sam Houston State University. He has more than 18 years of experience in teaching and research in forensic science. Dr. Yu worked as a criminalist for more than ten years before pursuing an academic career. Dr. Yu’s early scientific investigation focused on engineering a synthetic receptor using molecular imprinting. His research interests focus on detecting trace chemicals in physical evidence and on understanding their significance in scientific investigations. After his tenure, Dr. Yu focused his research efforts on applying nanomaterials for separation science and sensors. Dr. Yu’s research interests are diverse and span traditional areas of forensic chemistry, trace evidence examination, pattern evidence, crime scene reconstruction, and artificial intelligence. His research efforts have been supported by federal funding from the National Institute of Justice, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense, among others.
